    "This Notebook will be dedicated to parsing the Play-By-Play data from RetroSheets. This will allow us to gather data on a per-player basis to give us many more features with the hope of deriving more meaningful results from the models we train. The goal for this parser will to give us a boxscore-like DataFrame for each game from 2014-2019. There will be 18 batters for both NL and AL games. For the sake of simplicity, pitching stats are not included in the PBP for now, but this can easily be changed for the future. Let's walk through how we'll parse this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will go through each play of each game, and update statistics for each player after each play. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fields of each player will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- (Home/Visitor) Player i:\n",
    "    - player id\n",
    "    - hits\n",
    "    - singles\n",
    "    - doubles\n",
    "    - triples\n",
    "    - walks\n",
    "    - bunts\n",
    "    - sacrifice hits\n",
    "    - sacrifice flys\n",
    "    - RBIs\n",
    "    - at bats\n",
    "    - number of stolen bases\n",
    "    - number times caught stealing\n",
    "    - number times picked off\n",
    "    - number of errors\n",
    "    \n",
    "Therefore each player has 15 fields associated with them, and since there will be 18 batters, there will be a total of 270 columns of batter data. An example of one of these columns is \"Visiting Player i Errors\" where \"i\" is the ith player on the visiting team, which is determined by the \"batting\" flag in the event file and \"Errors\" is determined by summing the number of errors that player committed over the course of a single game.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the 270 batter data columns, there will be one column for the game ID, which be used to get the stats on a per-game basis."
